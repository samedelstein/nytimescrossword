In April 2020, I decided to start playing the NY Times Mini Crossword puzzle. I collected data about how many times I won, how many times I needed help, and how quickly I completed each puzzle. Along the way, I wanted to try using dbt to transform the data so I could dig into the data more (average times to complete by weekday, etc). This is the dbt project I built.
